This repository contains a collection of hardware
digital filter implementations coded with [myhdl](http://myhdl.org).

<!--
If any of the filter blocks and/or code from this repository are

The paper "A comparison of efficient first decimation filters
for continuous time delta sigma modulators", presented at the
2017 IEEE Asilomar Signals, Systems, and Computers conference
used the blocks in the
[edf](https://github.com/cfelton/filter-blocks/filter_blocks/edf)
(efficient decimation filter) directory.

<!--
Many of the filter blocks in this repository can be configured
and anaylyzed with the [pyfda]() tool.
