    "### Create FIR filter with integer coefficients\n",
    "Here is an example of how you can create a filter with integer coefficients. In this example, scipy library is used to generate floating point filter coefficients which are then converted to integers.\n",
    "#### Create filter coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import scipy.signal as signal\n",
    "\n",
    "fs = 1000.\n",
    "f1 = 45.\n",
    "f2 = 95.\n",
    "b = signal.firwin(3,[f1/fs*2,f2/fs*2])    #3 taps\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we need to convert the coefficients to integers for which they will need to be scaled. For this example we assume, the coefficients are scaled to 18 bits. The exponent of the scale factor is determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "B1 = 18 # Number of bits for coefficients\n",
    "L1 = math.floor(math.log((2**(B1-1)-1)/max(b), 2))  #Scale factor exponent\n",
    "bsc = b*(2**L1) #scaled coefficients\n",
    "bsc_int = [int(x) for x in bsc] #convert coefficient to type int\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Build the FIR Filter\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "from filter_blocks.fda import FilterFIR\n",
    "hdlfilter = FilterFIR()\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Set the Filter Parameters to Work with Integers\n",
    "Next, we set the input parameters of the filter to appropriate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "hdlfilter.set_word_format(coeff_w = (18, 17, 0), input_w = (12,11,0), output_w = (24,23,0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Args:<br>\n",
    "coeff_w (tuple of int): word format (W,WI,WF)<br>\n",
    "input_w (tuple of int): word format (W,WI,WF)<br>\n",
    "output_w (tuple of int): word format (W,WI,WF)<br>\n",
    "Where WI is the number of integer bits, WF is the number of fractional bit and W = WI+WF+1 (extra 1 for the sign bit). It is important to set the coefficient bits to 18, as this was used to calculate the scaling factor. In this example we are assuming that the input signal is of 12 bits and the output is set to 24 bits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we pass the filter coefficients as determined earlier.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hdlfilter.set_coefficients(coeff_b = bsc_int)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Stimulus for the Filter\n",
    "We generate an input signal (stimulus) for the filter by following the same steps that were used for the coefficients, discussed previously. In this example, create a signal which is a sine wave:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "N=20 #length of input signal\n",
    "sig = [np.sin(0.1*np.pi*i) for i in np.arange(0,N,1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "B2 = 12 # Number of bits\n",
    "L2 = math.floor(math.log((2**(B2-1)-1)/max(sig), 2))  # calculate scaling factor\n",
    "\n",
    "sig = np.multiply(sig, 2**L2) \n",
    "sig = sig.round()\n",
    "sig = sig.astype(int)\n",
    "\n",
    "hdlfilter.set_stimulus(sig) #pass the stimulus to the filter object\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter the input signal generated above, we need to run a simulation and obtain the output signal. Enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "hdlfilter.run_sim()\n",
    "y = hdlfilter.get_response()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Filter-blocks returns a numpy array of the output which is stored in 'y'. Here y is a 24 bits as was set earlier, meaning that some bits might have possibly been discarded to fit the output. The most significant 24 bits from the accumulator are assigned to y.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting design to Verilog or VHDL\n",
    "```python \n",
    "hdlfilter.convert(hdl = 'VHDL')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "hdl: 'VHDL' or 'Verilog'. Defaults to Verilog.\n",
